In the Harry Potter novels, children attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belong to one of four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each year, the houses assemble a Quidditch team of seven players to compete for the coveted Quidditch Cup. Your task is to help the coach determine if the team has enough players.

Directions:
Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if the array has at least seven players.

Test your code with the following teams:

const team1 = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
const team2 = ["George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
const team3 = [];
const team4 = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter", "Hermione Granger", "Ron Weasley", "Neville Longbottom"];
Running Your Code
Enter the following in the terminal:

node quidditch.js
When your code runs, you should get this output:

true
false
